# 8bit_calculator
Overview

This project is an 8-bit calculator designed and implemented using Logisim. The circuit supports basic arithmetic operations and demonstrates the fundamentals of digital logic design.

Features

8-bit Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
Binary Input & Output: Uses 8-bit binary representation for calculations.
Logic Components: Utilizes multiplexers and adders.
Designed in Logisim: A digital logic simulation software.

How It Works
Input Mechanism:
Two 8-bit binary numbers are provided as inputs.
A selection mechanism (e.g., control bits or a multiplexer) determines the operation to be performed.

Additional logic ensures correct handling of carry/borrow operations.

Output Display:
The result is displayed on 7-segment display in the hexadecimal format.
Overflow and error flags may be included for invalid operations.
